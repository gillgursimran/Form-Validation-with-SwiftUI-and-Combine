Use of SwiftUI bindings to capture entered text and control the text field's first responder status.
Observe and react to the text field's input.
Set the text field's placeholder.

Control over how and when text changes should be permitted.
Control over if the text field should begin or end editing.
Display text input errors and text field name. 

Installation

Just Drag OurTextField.Swift file from source code into any project you need to use.

Usage is Easy

struct ExampleView: View {
  @State var email: String = ""
  @State var isValidEmail: Bool = false
  @State var emailError: String = ""

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      OurTextField(
          placeholder: Strings.placeholderEmail,
          text: $email,
          isValid: $isValidEmail,
          error: $emailError,
          emptyMessage: Strings.requiredField,
          keyboardType: .asciiCapable,
          textFieldType: .square
      )
    }
  }
